summary = "Singer Kim Jong Kook, who married a non-celebrity in September, recently delivered joyful news just one month into his marriage by successfully wrapping up his 30th debut anniversary concert. Held on October 18 and 19 at the Blue Square SOL Travel Hall in Yongsan, Seoul, the concert titled “The Originals” sold out all tickets as soon as they opened, drawing in passionate fans eager to celebrate the singer’s incredible three-decade career. Opening with a grand VCR intro, the show kicked off with classic hits like “A Jazz Bar,” “December,” and “Love Forever.” Kim Jong Kook warmly greeted fans, saying, “I can’t believe it’s already been 30 years. This concert is only possible thanks to your unwavering support.” He reminisced about his early twenties, recalling his audition at singer Tae Jin Ah’s office and his debut with the group Turbo , eventually launching a solo career. “Many think ‘One Man’ was my solo debut song, but it was actually ‘I Wish You Happiness’ from my first album,” he revealed, laughing about how nervous he was during the recording and how he took calming pills to ease the anxiety. Kim didn’t shy away from discussing difficult moments, including agency disputes after his debut album, and his time on Let’s Go! Dream Team , which reignited his career. He energized the audience with beloved hits like “One Man,” “Addiction,” and “Forgive And Remember.” From his third album era with “Star, Wind, Sunlight and Love” to military enlistment days and the emotional ballad “Letter” from his fourth album, Kim showcased his versatile charm. He also recalled his entertainment heyday with Family Outing and Running Man , tying in stories from his fifth album era. Performing “Today More Than Yesterday” and “This Is the Person” with his signature honey vocals, he then revisited his 7th album Journey Home, performing its title track “Men Are All Like That.” As the concert neared its end, Kim shared heartfelt words: “We looked back on 30 years of my career today. It’s been a meaningful journey. I’ll continue to meet you on stage and on screen. Let’s reunite again for my 40th and even 50th anniversaries.” The climax came with a Turbo medley, featuring high-energy songs like “X,” “Choice,” “Love Is…,” “Black Cat Nero,” “Twist King,” “Good Bye Yesterday,” and “White Love (At the Ski Park).” The crowd roared with excitement. On the first night, guests Cha Tae Hyun and Ma Sun Ho joined to celebrate, while Yang Se Chan, Jonathan, and Shorry J lit up the final night with warm camaraderie. During the photo time segment, Kim created special memories with fans. For the last song, he performed “My Heart Is The Love”, delivering a sincere message that deeply moved the audience. Even after the concert ended, fans’ cheers for an encore continued. Responding with joy, Kim sang “Lovable” and “As Good As It Gets”, wrapping up the night with gratitude and love."
